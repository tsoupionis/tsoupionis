- 👋 Hi, I’m @tsoupionis a Computer Science student at CUNY Queens College
- 📊 I have a strong interest in data analysis and enjoy diving deep into datasets to uncover meaningful insights. I am proficient in Python, which I've utilized extensively during my time at CodePath's Intro to Software Engineering and the Break Through Tech Program in AI at Cornell Tech
- 🔍 Currently, I'm leading a data analysis project that combines my interest in data and my proficiency in Python. We're examining the GPA of teachers for every class from 2017-Fall 2022 (excluding 2020 data) to help future students make informed decisions about their course selections. You can check out our progress here: https://github.com/QC-Data-Science/QC-Grade-Distribution
- 💼 In my professional journey, I've held roles that allowed me to apply and grow my technical skills. As an AI Fellow at Cornell Tech's Break Through Tech Program, I dove into machine learning foundations and worked with large-scale, real-world datasets. As a Lead STEM Coding Instructor at Code Advantage, I've developed and taught curricula for young learners
- 🔭 Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue expanding my skills in data science, machine learning, and AI, and exploring how these technologies can be used to solve complex real-world problems
